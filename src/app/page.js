                    It was started from our experience as GCSE students -
                    desperately searching for resources to help us achieve the
                    high marks we craved. However, we often found that many
                    resources were locked behind paywalls, or difficult to find
                    - as they were spread across the internet. As a result of
                    this, we made our own resources - which ended in neither of
                    us dropping below a Grade 8 at GCSE.{" "}

                <p className="section-text">
                    As A-Level students, many of these resources sit idly on
                    computers - unused, and unneeded. So in response, we’ve
                    decided to create a platform to share these. The future
                    students of the world will experience the same thing we went
                    through - and we’d love to make it easier for them to access
                    items to enrich their studying.{" "}

                    By joining our mission, you have the chance to positively
                    impact thousands of students across the country. The
                    resources you've meticulously created can find a new
                    purpose. Additionally, you can showcase this experience as
                    volunteering for a non-profit organization on university or
                    job applications. You will also gain access to a network of
                    contributors, many of whom are high achieving students. It's
                    a meaningful way to help others while advancing your own
                    goals.
